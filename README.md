# MOOC Python Programming 2022 Part 1

I am just beginning my journey into programming through the University of Helsinki's online course (MOOC).

## Goals

- To complete the course effectively and within a productive time constraint.
- To learn the principles of programming, particularly with Python.
- To prepare myself with the necessary foundation to move forwards into artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- To make sure I am actually learning the material through rehearsal.
- To ensure that I am not tardy within my dev space, and am able to understand git commits at a basic level.
