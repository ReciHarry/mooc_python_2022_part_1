# This section will mostly consist of very basic print exercises.

# Learning Objectives
# You will have written and executed your first Python program
# You will know how to use the print command
# You will be able to use programming for arithmetic operations

# Programming exercise: Emoticon
# Please write a program which prints out an emoticon: :-)

print(":-)")

# Programming exercise: Fix the code: Seven Brothers
# "Seitsemän veljestä" is one of the first novels ever written in Finnish. 
# It is the story of seven orphaned brothers learning to make their way in the world (read more on Wikipedia).
# This program is supposed to print out the names of the brothers in alphabetical order, but it's not working quite right yet. 
# Please fix the program so that the names are printed in the correct order.

print("Aapo")
print("Eero")
print("Juhani")
print("Lauri")
print("Simeoni")
print("Timo")
print("Tuomas")

# Programming exercise: Row, Row, Row Your Boat
# Please write a program which prints out the following lines exactly as they are written here, punctuation and all:

print("Row, row, row your boat,")
print("Gently down the stream.")
print("Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,")
print("Life is but a dream.")

# Programming exercise: Minutes in a year
# Please write a program which prints out the number of minutes in a year. 
# Use Python code to perform the calculation, as in the previous code example.

# there are 60*24 minutes in a day and 365 days in a year
print((60 * 24) * 365)

# Programming exercise: Print some code
# Thus far, you have probably used double quotation marks " to print out strings. 
# In addition to the double quotation marks, Python also accepts single quotation marks '.
# This comes in handy if you ever want to print out the actual quotation marks themselves:

print('print("Hello there!")')
